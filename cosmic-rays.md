# Cosmic Rays

- Primary cosmic rays (those entering the atmosphere from space) are light nuclei: 86% protons, 13% alpha particles and the remaining 1% heavier nuclei.
- Within the atmosphere these primary cosmic rays induce a sequential cascade of secondary particles due principally to nuclear reactions with atmospheric constituents.
- The incident protons knock out further protons, neutrons and pions from nuclei. All three of these types of particle are able to knock out further protons, neutrons and pions, causing a cascade. These particles constitute the hadronic component of cosmic rays.
- The cascade effect causes the flux of these types of particle to increase with decreasing altitude. However since the cascade particles are gradually losing energy in nuclear reactions and electromagnetic interactions as they descend, the probability of further particle production decreases and the probability of particle capture increases. (For pions this effect is augmented by pions short lifetime before decaying.) Hence the flux eventually reaches a peak value and then declines.
- The pion flux declines to very low values by sea level, since the pion production probability drops off more strongly with decreasing incident particle energy, and pions have a short lifetime. The proton flux decreases by three orders of magnitude through the atmosphere. Neutron fluxes are higher and decrease less severely since neutrons are uncharged and interact less frequently. However, the hadronic component will reach only very shallow depths in the ocean; (10 m of water is roughly equivalent, in terms of areal mass, to the entire atmosphere: approx. 1000 g/cm2).
- In addition to the hadronic component, the decay of pions in the atmosphere gives rise to both muons and to high-energy photons and electrons.
- Neutral pions decay into high-energy photons, which undergo pair production, producing electrons and positrons. These emit Bremsstrahlung radiation, the energy of which is typically still high enough to cause pair production, etc. The result is an electron/photon cascade which continues until the photons have low-enough energy that Compton scattering begins to dominate over pair production, and the electrons have low-enough energy that ionisation and excitation dominate over bremsstrahlung. This threshold is called the critical energy, Ec.
- Charged pions decay into similarly charged muons (and neutrinos). Muons have a tiny nuclear interaction cross-section (around 10 μb, compared to neutron cross-sections in the range mb to tens of kb). They are therefore highly penetrating. They have energies up to hundreds of GeV, with a peak in the spectrum at around 0.5 GeV. Naturally the muon production rate declines with altitude due to the decrease in pion flux, so most muons are produced reatively high in the atmosphere. Around 20% of 1 GeV muons survive to sea level, and 80% of 10 GeV muons.

## Muons

- Since muons are the only particles that can penetrate to any depth in the ocean, it is worth considering them and their effects in more detail.
- The bulk – 90% - of muons are produced at altitudes above 10 km.
- Muons lose energy through electronic interactions  - excitation, ionisation – and at energies above ~200 GeV through bremsstrahlung, pair production and photonuclear reactions. Hence high energy (>200 GeV) muons produce electron photon showers along their trajectory as they travel.



- The average energy loss due to ionisation is about 2 MeV/(g/cm2)
- Muons decay with a half-life of 2.2 μs (in the muon rest frame), but taking into account reltivistic time dilation, a 2 GeV muon has a 46 μs half-life, and the half-life increases linearly with energy.
- Muons decay into electrons or positrons depending on their charge, pus two neutrinos per decay. If the muon is in flight the electron receives about 1/3 of the muon's kinetic energy with the rest carried away by a neutrino. If the muon decays after it has been brought to rest by ionisation, the decay electron and neutrino share the muon rest mass of 106 MeV. In this case the maximum electron energy is about 50 MeV and the mean about 40 MeV.
- Slowed-down muons are eventually captured by atoms and take up atomic orbitals, thus emitting X-rays. The higher rest mass of the muon (105.7 MeV as opposed to 0.511 MeV for the electron) means the orbital is much closer in than electronic orbitals, and muonic X-rays have higher energy.
- Muons may then be captured by the nucleus, undergoing the reaction μ + p → n + υ. The probability of capture increases with increasing atomic number, dominating over muon decay as a loss mechanism for high-Z nuclei. For Z = 20, 80% of negative muons are captures, and at Z = 50, 95% are captured. The rest mass of the muon (105.7 MeV) is released and leaves the nucleus in a highly excited state, from which it de-excites by emitting one or more neutrons. This provides a mechanism for producing further neutrons (in addition to those in the hadronic component)
