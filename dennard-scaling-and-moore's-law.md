Dennard showed (or predicted?) that the properties of semiconductor devices
would scale by a constant, $k$, in a given period (i.e. vary exponentially).
The linear dimensions would scale as $1/k$, and fortuitously, so would both the
voltage and the current. Each new generation of technology, arriving on a
roughly two-year cycle, has resulted in a reduction of the linear dimension of
$\approx 0.7$ (i.e. $k \approx 1.4$). This has resulted in approximately a
doubling ($1.4^2$) of the number of transistors on a processor every two years,
which is Moore's Law. The voltage and the current required have also reduced by
$1/1.4$ each generation, so the power has halved and the power density -
$IV/L^2$ - has remained constant. The stagnation in processor clock speeds at
around 3 GHz since about 2005 is a result of a lower limit in the voltage, due
to problems with leakage. The trend for performance increase has hit a `power
wall'.
